Democracy is not the rule of the majority, but the protection of the minority.  My name is Vincent Juillard and I represent Ousia, where we are rethinking the way democracy is implemented in the digital world.

 Today, we have a major problem: how to protect minorities while promoting balanced and equitable participation in digital governance spaces, such as DAOs. Governance attacks and the marginalization of minority voices are unfortunately common in existing DAOs.

 We found the solution with Ousia.  We have developed a DAO that weights both the individual's vote and their monetary power, creating a balance between capitalism and communism, and ensuring fair representation of all parties.  Our users can link their unique WorldCoin identity to their web3 address, and use this platform to vote on any topic. When the vote closes, the votes are counted taking into account the individual and their monetary power, in order to determine the result that benefits all.

The potential market for our solution is global. Whether you are an individual seeking protection from mainstream capitalism, or seeking to avoid impoverishment through communism, our solution provides you with a fair and fairer way to participate in decision-making.

 We have already demonstrated our system in action, as you can see in this ballot proposal.

 This proposal made it possible to evolve from an individualistic short-term vision towards an inclusive long-term vision.

 We are currently looking for individuals willing to change the way power is organized on a global scale.  If you're interested in helping every individual grow and contribute to the world's most trusted and extensive source of information, we'd love to hear from you.

 To sum up, Ousia aims to give equal strength to every individual, regardless of their monetary power, to reach a lasting agreement on any subject.
